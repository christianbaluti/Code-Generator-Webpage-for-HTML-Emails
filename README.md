# Code-Generator-Webpage-for-HTML-Emails
I have build a webpage where you can put in the email title, email content and sub email content at the end to generate a modern email that looks like a web page for Dream Code Malawi.

## How to use this?
you need to use any email client that lets you put html emails and send. In my case I dont have money for such premium service so I use Microsoft Outlook where i install this plugin called 'Insert HTML by DesignModo'
after you have such way of using html as your email then use the index.html page
that page you can input the email title, content and some other conent (optional this one)
then after you generate the code and copy it

when you go to your email client, outlook in my case, i will use the plugin we installed and paste the code there.

thats it
